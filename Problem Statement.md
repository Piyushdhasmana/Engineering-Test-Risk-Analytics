Engineering Test:
1. Write Python code that traverses through the files in the zipped folder (Engineering Test
Files) and generates the combined.csv file also found in that folder.
When writing the code:


a. Try to make it as generic as possible such that if a new file called NA Preview.csv
gets dropped in the same folder, the script will be able to process it and rows in
the combined.csv file will be added with the environment value being set to NA
Preview.


b. Same applies if a new file called Asia Prod 4.csv gets dropped. It should add new
rows to the combined.csv file with the environment being set to Asia Prod


c. Use best coding practices and write production ready code.


d. Please add unit tests for your code


e. We will be running the code on our end once it is submitted, please have the
code successfully execute without any errors
Note: Please unzip the folder outside of the code (one-time task) and use unzipped folder for
traversing through the files from within the code.

When the assignments are completed, please upload into your GitHub Repo and send us the
link. Ensure instructions are included on how to use your applications.
Good Luck!
